[00:11.76] Mass に合わせた lifestyle 無理でも楽すりゃ不利
[00:14.77] Freedom 謳歌 理不尽吹き飛ばす skill これ違う last minute
[00:18.27] Merci, au revoir
[00:19.34] Pride は邪魔する猛者 donc vas-y jete ca
[00:21.87] 全て tryし困憊 笛に救われ halftime
[00:33.87] 
[00:25.37] Kept walking on the wild side
[00:28.59] I don't wanna fall asleep throughout my life
[00:32.34] Sometimes in a buffalo style
[00:35.93] Sometimes like a rock 'n' roll mind
[00:53.43] 
[00:39.28] (Be wild side) climax 夢見 all in
[00:41.67] オッズ見えない blurred (try it)
[00:43.23] 気持ち飛び立つ boeing
[00:45.37] 一寸先はさぁ？
[00:48.87] 
[00:49.72] It is wonderful my life
[00:51.86] Please could you kiss my name
[00:53.60] When the music's over?
[00:55.58] Turn off light, it was such a sweet time
[00:58.94] Could you pray for me, my friend?
[01:00.87] It's starting over time
[01:12.37] 
[01:03.26] Taking overnight
[01:05.12] Taking over blue time
[01:07.29] If you heard that screaming, shout in your mind
[01:10.44] Taking over the shine
[01:12.33] Taking over the shooting star
[01:26.83] 
[01:14.28] All I was talking about was music
[01:18.22] (And that's called jazz!)
